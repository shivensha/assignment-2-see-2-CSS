<p>Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends</p>
  <p> When I'm sober I just don't like who I am  </p>
<p>Pour me up a four and I'll feel like myself again  </p>
<p>Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again</p>
<p1> I'ma break every box they try to put me in </p1>
    <p>I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends</p>
    <p>Pour me up a four and I'll feel like myself again</p>
    <p>Roll me up some dope <a1> and I'll fee</a1>like myself again </p>
        <p>  I was sober for an hour but I'm rollin' off a bean now</p>
    <p>The drugs, they give me confidence, I'm sayin' what I mean now</p>
    <p>The Xannies help me slow up, the lean it help me speed down </p>
    <p> Ballin', yeah I'm ballin', I won't hit it if she beat now</p>
    <p>Callin', yeah she callin', your bitch got me on the speed dial</p>
    <p>Driving through the Rex, I look at faces don't see no smiles</p>
    <p>It's grimy in the 6ix, who can I trust? I'll never know now</p>
    <p>Sprite is extra dark now, my doggie in the dog pound</p>
    <p>They say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down</p>
    <p>See me doin' good, <a2>they start to hate</a2>  that's how it goes now</p>
    <p>I don't know why <a3>stronger</a3> hey mad at me, I always stay ten toes down</p>
    <p>Drivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now
    </p>
    <p>I remember bein' a kid my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit</p>
    <p> Diamonds in my pinky, <a4>look like water, </a4>make me seasick</p>
    <p>Never had no help so don't approach me on some free shit</p>
    <p>Did this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?</p>
    <p>His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it</p>
    <p> Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it</p>
    <p2>Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'</p2>
    <p>Know some people in the 6ix that dissed me for no reason</p>
    <p>Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them</p>
    <p> Takin' Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them</p>
    <p><a5>Got your bitch beside me,</a5> she just asked me what a bean is</p>
    <p> Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it</p>
    <p>Drivin' solo <a6>I'm just swervin</a6>, through my ends</p>
    <p>Pour me up a four and I'll feel like myself again</p>
    <p>I'ma break every box they try to put me in</p>
    <p>Pour me up a four and I'll feel like myself again</p>
    <p>Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again</p>
    
    <p>Drivin' solo,  <a4>I'm just swervin' t</a4>  through my ends</p>
